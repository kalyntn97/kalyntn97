![Banner Image](/banner-image-update.png)

üåª  Hi! My name is Tran. I am a Software Engineer dedicated to creating user-friendly and whimsical designs that spark joy and smiles.

üñåÔ∏è  With a previous background in biotech and a passion for art, I am committed to crafting delightful digital experiences that seamlessly blend analytical power and creativity.

üê∂  When I am not coding I love to play with my dog and two cats. I also like drawing, coffee, going to concerts, and listening to podcasts.

‚òïÔ∏è  I'd love the opportunity to collaborate on a project, exchange greetings, and make some wonderful new friends!
